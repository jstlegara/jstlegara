- 👋 Hi, I’m @jstlegara. I have an undergraduate degree in Accountancy, and currently doing my Masters in Economics. I am a Senior Data Scientist for OptumLabs with a specialization on Diabetes Research
- 👀 I’m interested in making use of agent based modelling, or simulations, in creating simplified versions of real world scenarios, and perhaps predict outcomes from that 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java because I am interested in creating simple pseudo simulation games like dating simulations and the type
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything of interest, really. I'm always up for more learnings
- 📫 You can reach me through my email: johnsolomonlegara@gmail.com / john23legara@gmail.com
